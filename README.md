## About

This repository contains the source code for [jpeg-butcher.sascha.app](https://jpeg-butcher.sascha.app), a project for manipulating JPEG files using a hex editor.

### Privacy

Images uploaded to the website will never leave the browser and stay cached entirely on each local device for the duration of the usage of the website. There is neither any data transfer to third-party servers, nor does the original server process any data from those images. In fact, the website is even purely offline accessible‚Äîso once opened on the local device, the website won't need any communication to its hosting server, other than occasionally fetching updates for website assets (e.g. logos, icons, etc...).

## How it works

_work in progress_

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn start

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn serve
```

## Contribution

This is very much a hacky project and could use some formatting-, testing- and documentation love. Feel free to reach out, if you're interested.
